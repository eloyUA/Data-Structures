### General information
An data structur, is an implemntation of all the functions to store data in different forms.
For example, in this repository, we have a stack (dinamic and static), a queue (dinamic and static),
a linked list (obviously dynamic) and a dictionary.

### Installation
First, we need to know that all data structures in this repository are modules. Therefore, we need another C file to execute them.
So, if we want to compile this file 'main.c' and use the dynamic stack module:

```git clone https://github.com/eloyUA/Data-Structures```
```cd dinamicStack```
```gcc -c dinamicStack.c```
```gcc [path of the main.c] dinamicStack.o -o nameProgram```
